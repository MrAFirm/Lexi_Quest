# Lexi_Quest
My effort on a recreation of Wordle using CPP. Called "Lexi Quest". It's extremely complicated that even i don't understand certain things I wrote, I will however learn all of it one step at a time. This game works, but it doesn't tell you if the characters in your guesses are correct or wrong. Will update in the future. 5-letter words only.

# How to run the game?
Use the Makefile, and type in your terminal "make", then type ./exe to run the program. (Be sure that the Directory names are correct! ["Gameplay" & "Header"])

# How to play the game?
After launching the program, you'll be in a menu state, type 1 or 2 to pick an option, and press enter to continue. Then, start typing your 5-letter word guesses, you'll have 6 tries, and if you miss the right word, the program will prompt you the type guess again up until the maximum number of tries, if during one of your attempts you successfully guessed correctly, then you'll be shown a congratulations message, if you fail to guess correctly in all attempts given, then you'll be shown a game over message with the correct letter. Then the program ends. If you wish to continue, type ./exe in the terminal to play again.
